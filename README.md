#### 📌 Highlights
- 🌙 **Low-Light Gaussian Initialization**: Robust 3D Gaussian initialization without reliance on SfM tools like COLMAP.
- 🔀 **Gaussian Decomposition**: Dual-branch modeling of intrinsic vs. transient scene components.
- 🎥 **View Synthesis in the Dark**: State-of-the-art rendering quality under low-light and nighttime conditions.
